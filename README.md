# PhilipsHackabout 16
Affect of Metabolic Obesity and Body Mass Index in Coronary Artery Diseases
September 2016
Aim of the project was to-
• Train a model capable of predicting the GENSINI score which determines the severity of CAD in the following groups- Metabolically Healthy Normal Weight (MHNW), Metabolically Obese Normal Weight (MONW), Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHO) and Metabolically Abnormal Obese (MAO).
• Find the group showing a good association to severity of CAD that is which category is more prone to CAD, metabolically obese or phenotypically obese. 
• Find the prognostic markers for CAD among factors like HBA1C, FI, HOMA IR , TC, TG, HDL, LDL and hsCRP and which group shows more association? 

The data was collected by Kasturba Medical College, Manipal. The machine learning model was trained and tested in R.
The results obtained were presented at Hackabout 2016, a data analysis challenge, organized by Philips in Manipal University.
